/*
     PROJECT 2: SNAKE, WATER, GUN

Snake, water, gun or rock, paper, scissors is a game most of us have played during
school time. (I sometimes play it even now).

Write a C program capable of playing this game with you.

Your program should be able to print the result after you choose snake/water or gun.
